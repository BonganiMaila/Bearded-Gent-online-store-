8.7.      Signing “Unchecked”, “Not Checked” or similar is not acceptable.

8.8.      If we agree with you to deliver on a particular day or at a particular time, we will do our best to comply. But no time given is to be treated as contractual. So we are not liable to you for any expense or inconvenience you incur on account of delayed delivery or non-delivery.
